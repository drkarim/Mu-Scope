	The filename should not be changed as it is hard-coded in the following places: 
	1. index.php

	Notes:
	======
	1. Every specimen must have a <title>, <subtitle> and a <description>, this is a bare minimum 
	2. All images should be 300 pixels in height and 700 pixels in width
	3. In description, only text accepted, hyper-links will not work 
	4. More specimen groups can be added to this XML, however, there is no real functionality in the php to handle multiple groups yet (as of March 2016)
