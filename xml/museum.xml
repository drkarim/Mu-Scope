	The filename should not be changed as it is hard-coded in the following places:
	1. index.php

	Notes:
	======
	1. Every specimen must have a <title>, <subtitle> and a <description>, this is a bare minimum
	2. All images should be 300 pixels in height and 700 pixels in width
	3. In description, only text accepted, hyper-links will not work
	4. More specimen groups can be added to this XML, however, there is no real functionality in the php to handle multiple groups yet (as of March 2016)

			<introduction>A hedgehog is any of the spiny mammals of the subfamily Erinaceinae, in the order Eulipotyphla. There are seventeen species of hedgehog in five genera, found through parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction. There are no hedgehogs native to Australia, and no living species native to the Americas (the extinct genus Amphechinus was once present in North America). Hedgehogs share distant ancestry with shrews (family Soricidae), with gymnures possibly being the intermediate link, and have changed little over the last 15 million years. Like many of the first mammals, they have adapted to a nocturnal way of life. Hedgehogs' spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated porcupines, which are rodents, and echidnas, a type of monotreme.</introduction>

			<stl_description>The adult dentition includes a total of 36 teeth, dental formula I3/2, C 1/1, P 3/2, M 3/3. The deciduous dentition includes 24 teeth; these are shed by 3-4 months of age. Dental abnormalities are not uncommon in Britain and may be particularly common in the population in New Zealand. The eyes are bright black and of moderate size. They are neither enlarged for acute nocturnal vision nor reduced in size. They are normally somewhat prominent. Hoglet neonates are born with their eyes sealed closed.</stl_description>

			<dicom_description>An adult hedgehog has short, broad rounded ears, mainly hidden by hair and a long narrow snout with a moist black rhinarium (tip of the nose). The small broad skull contains a relatively small brain. Hoglet neonates are born with their ears sealed closed. </dicom_description>
