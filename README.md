# Mu-Scope
Web framework for listing DICOMs that uses the DWV web dicom viewer

## ROADMAP 

### Things to do 

[ ] **Write custom css** to replace the bootstrap theme. (Custom fonts, introduce some subtle colour etc).
[ ] **Create a vertebrae page template, so dicom, stl and information about the animal all appear together in unison**. Will have to point to XML file, so with every different specimen the information, dicom and stl are different but the format will always be the same. Might be fun to assign a different colour to each specimen? 
[ ] **Create a homepage** so there is a small introduction about the life sciences museum, and then five different divs for each collection (the Zoological Collection, Botanical Collection, Pharmaceutical Collection, Microscope Slide Collection, Craniofacial Skeletal Collection). The navbar at the top should include (HOME, COLLECTIONS, WHATâ€™S ON, ABOUT).
[ ] **Zoological collection page** or the current landing page, needs photos. Custom CSS will be implemented here.

### New Ideas and Suggestions

- **[Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/models/209bffe6866042379a704ce46bb6e632)** - example from the natural history museum in Oxford. Same thing as what we are doing however will be harder to implement it all automatically. Quality is very good though, useful for ideas. Has google cardboard support which could be interesting.
